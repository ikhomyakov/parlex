//! # Arena Terms Parser
//!
//! Parser for arena-backed Prolog-like terms.
//!
//! This crate provides a parser for reading and interpreting Prolog-style terms
//! into the compact, bump-allocated arena representation provided by the
//! [`arena_terms`] crate. It is built on top of the [`parlex`] runtime library and uses
//! lexer and parser code generated by the [`parlex_gen`] tools **Alex** (lexer)
//! and **ASLR** (parser).
//!
//! # Overview
//! The parser is designed for performance and memory efficiency, making it
//! suitable for large-scale term manipulation, logic engines, and symbolic
//! computation. It supports the full range of Prolog term constructs, including
//! atoms, numbers, lists, and compound structures, while maintaining tight
//! control over allocation through arena-based storage.
//!
//! # Modules
//! - [`lexer`]: Performs tokenization and value extraction (atoms, numbers, dates, etc.).
//! - [`oper`]: Defines operator fixity, precedence, and associativity rules.
//! - [`parser`]: Implements an SLR parser that constructs `arena_terms::Term` values.
//!
//! # Dependencies
//! - [`arena_terms`]: Provides the arena-backed term data structures.
//! - [`parlex`]: Runtime support for lexing and parsing.
//! - [`parlex_gen`]: Code generation utilities for **Alex** and **ASLR**.
//!
